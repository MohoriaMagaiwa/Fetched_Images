🧠 Avoids duplicates by comparing image hashes

🔒 Validates content type to ensure only images are saved

🛡️ Uses respectful HTTP headers to fetch resources responsibly

📁 Automatically organizes images in a Fetched_Images directory

💛 Follows the Ubuntu principle of connecting and sharing

📸 Example Usage

Terminal Output:

🌍 Welcome to the Ubuntu Image Gatherer

🔗 Enter image URLs (separated by commas): https://example.com/pic1.jpg, https://example.com/pic2.png

📡 Connecting to: https://example.com/pic1.jpg
✅ Successfully fetched and saved: pic1.jpg

📡 Connecting to: https://example.com/pic2.png

The script checks Content-Type to ensure the file is an image.

It ignores duplicates using image hash comparison.

It uses a custom User-Agent to fetch resources politely.
